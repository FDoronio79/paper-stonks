Today:

* We brainstormed ideas for our team application and decided to build a paper trading application. 

Other ideas involved recreating popular apps like Airbnb and Uber. Ultimately, the paper trading idea seemed to spark the most interest. Stretch goals include making a game from the app and we could compete against each other to see who trades best.

Today:

* We worked as a group to design the wireframe for our site. 

We utilized Figma to design the wireframe. It took several days for us to complete the wireframes and as the project progresses, we'll most likely make additional changes to it.

Today:

* We worked on the API design and modeling.

We used excalidraw and made some simple models and API designs. I realize now, that we'll most likely have to rethink our model structure as we delve into working with FastAPIs and PostgreSQL. Still, we thought of some good endpoints to work from.

Today:

* We successfully set up Heroku!

We ensured that everyone had cloned the Paper Stonks application. Tiffany took the lead in configuring the application to work with Heroku. We now have that working.

Today:

* We successfully locally deployed our application!

I was out for most of the day. Upon returning, my team had set up the Docker files, following the instructions from "Project Advice". The team decided to use a PostgeSQL database and pgAdmin was added to the Docker configuration.
